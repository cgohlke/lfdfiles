Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) file formats
=======================================================

Lfdfiles is a Python library and console script for reading, writing,
converting, and viewing many of the proprietary file formats used
to store experimental data and metadata at the
`Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/>`_.
For example:

- SimFCS VPL, VPP, JRN, BIN, INT, CYL, REF, BH, BHZ, B64, I64, Z64, R64
- FLIMbox FBD, FBF, FBS.XML
- GLOBALS LIF, ASCII
- CCP4 MAP
- Vaa3D RAW
- Bio-Rad(r) PIC
- ISS Vista IFLI, IFI
- FlimFast FLIF

Quickstart
----------

Install the lfdfiles package and all dependencies from the
`Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/lfdfiles/>`_::

    python -m pip install -U lfdfiles[all]

Print the console script usage::

    python -m lfdfiles --help

The lfdfiles library is type annotated and documented via docstrings.

See `Examples`_ for using the programming interface.

Source code and support are available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/cgohlke/lfdfiles>`_.

Notes
-----

The API is not stable yet and might change between revisions.

Python <= 3.8 is no longer supported. 32-bit versions are deprecated.

The latest `Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022
<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/
the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads>`_ is required on Windows.

Many of the LFD's file formats are not documented and might change arbitrarily.
This implementation is mostly based on reverse engineering existing files.
No guarantee can be made as to the correctness of code and documentation.

Experimental data are often stored in plain binary files with metadata
available in separate, human readable journal files (`.jrn`).

Unless specified otherwise, data are stored in little-endian, C contiguous
order.

Examples
--------

Create a Bio-Rad PIC file from a NumPy array:

>>> data = numpy.arange(1000000).reshape(100, 100, 100).astype('u1')
>>> bioradpic_write('_biorad.pic', data)

Read the volume data from the PIC file as NumPy array, and access metadata:

>>> with BioradPic('_biorad.pic') as f:
...     f.shape
...     f.spacing
...     data = f.asarray()
(100, 100, 100)
(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

Convert the PIC file to a compressed TIFF file:

>>> with BioradPic('_biorad.pic') as f:
...     f.totiff('_biorad.tif', compression='zlib')
